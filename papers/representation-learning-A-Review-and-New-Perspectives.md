# Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives
Yoshua Bengioy, Aaron Courville, and Pascal Vincent

## Paper Type: 
Review

## Paper Topic
Feature Engineering or Data Representation

## Paper Summary
This paper reviews the work in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning and deep networks.

## What are the problems? 
Current maching learning algorithms are unable to extract or organize discriminative information from the data (i.e. data representation). The process of feature engineering depends too much on human ingenuity and prior knowledge.

## Why it's important to solve the problems? 


## What solutions are the authors proposing? 


## How do the authors solve the problem? 


## What are the important concepts and technologies that are explained well in the paper?

## What are possible future research directions suggested in the paper? 

## What are the concepts that I need to look further into?
